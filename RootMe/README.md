# RootMe

This directory contains every boxes I've owned on [RootMe](https://www.root-me.org). Those are accessible in the `CTF all the day` section and only boxes which do not come from a challenge i.e. which do not give points are published in this repo.

- `README.md` is my personnal writeup of the box. It can be detailed or not depending on the things I've learned with the box and how much I appreciated it. Some may not even have a writeup if it was something I already knew about or if it was not interesting for me.

- `notes` are the notes I use during my pentest. Those are just personnal notes I write while I'm working on the box to keep traces of what I'm doing.

- Other files, scripts, images for the writeup, downloaded resources...
