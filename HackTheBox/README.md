# Hack The Box

This directory contains every boxes I've owned on [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home). Those are only retired boxes.

For every box:

- `README.md` is my personnal writeup of the box. It can be detailed or not depending on the things I've learned with the box and how much I appreciated it. Some may not even have a writeup if it was something I already knew about or if it was not interesting for me.

- `notes` are the notes I use during my pentest. Those are just personnal notes I write while I'm working on the box to keep traces of what I'm doing.

- Other files, scripts, images for the writeup, downloaded resources...
